# Currency Converter 💱

A simple, beautiful currency converter web app built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.

- 🔁 Swap currencies with one click
- 🎯 Live exchange rates
- 🌙 Clean, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS
- ⚡ Instant result calculation without reloading
- 🛡️ Modern React best practices (hooks, reusable components)


## 🚀 Installation

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

```bash

# Move into the project directory

## 💡 How It Works

- User enters an amount and selects source (`From`) and target (`To`) currencies.
- Clicking **Convert** fetches the live exchange rate and shows the result.
- Clicking **Swap** switches the selected currencies instantly.

## 📋 To-Do (Future Improvements)

- ✅ Loading indicators while fetching rates
- 🚀 Error handling for API failures
- 🌍 Multi-language support
- 📈 Graph view of currency trends (bonus feature)
- 🧪 Add unit & integration tests
